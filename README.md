The goal of LINEaR is to provide clean summary output
and diagnostic tools for LINE assumptions (Linearity,
Independence, Normality and Equal Variance) in linear
regression. Users can view visual diagnostics and
perform statistical tests for each assumption, and also
view a summary of validity for all four assumptions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LINEaR from GitHub using:

``` r

devtools::install_github("ashinishah/LINEaR")
